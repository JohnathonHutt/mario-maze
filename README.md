Part dungeon crawler, part memory game, part mine sweeper w/ styles borrowed (lovingly) from the NES Super Mario series.

The object of this game is to move through the maze, ideally finding the shortest path and collecting 1-ups to maximize points.

You begin at the bottom and make a path through the maze by clicking on adjacent tiles.

Items you will encounter:

Blocks: prevent passage
spiny shells: cost lives
1-ups: extra life plus point bonus
boos: eject you from the maze

There are four levels currently, the maps do not change so you can remember your successful paths and/or optimize your path for more points.

Thanks for playing - I hope you enjoy it.
